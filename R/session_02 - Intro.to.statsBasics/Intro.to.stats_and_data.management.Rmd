# Session outline

- External packages.\vspace{5mm}
- Data transformations - basics.\vspace{5mm}
- Steps in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Numeric summaries
   - Visualizations.\vspace{5mm}
   
- Robust ways of creating contingency tables\vspace{5mm}

- Exporting/saving outputs for later use.



# External packages

- R packages are contributed libraries for increased efficiency.\vspace{5mm}

- There are currently over 18,200 packages in [\textcolor{blue}{CRAN}](https://cran.r-project.org/) repository.\vspace{5mm}

- Install package - `install.packages("name")`.\vspace{5mm}

- Load package `library("name")` or `require("name")`.


# Data transformation - Basics

- Critical step in analysing and summarizing data .\vspace{2mm}

- Common forms of data.
     - Long format - observation appears multiple times (longitudinal data)
     - Wide format - observation appears ONLY once

- Variable transformations.
     - For computing necessary statistics
     - Outputting correct summaries
     - Effective visualization

- Saving objects (datasets, summary tables and plots).
