# What is R

- R is both a scripted programming language and software environment for statistical computing.\vspace{5mm}

- R is widely used for statistical analysis and creation of high-quality publishable graphics.\vspace{5mm}

- It's open source, free to use and supported by a large community of users and developers. \vspace{5mm}

- Flexible and highly scalable via user defined packages and functions.


# Why R

- \textcolor{blue}{Reproducibility} - one code; multiple users and projects .\vspace{5mm}

- \textcolor{blue}{Flexible} and easy to learn.\vspace{5mm}

- \textcolor{blue}{Scalability} - You can define/customize your own functions and/or packages. \vspace{5mm}

- \textcolor{blue}{Interoperability} - same code across platforms (mac, windows, linux etc).


# Getting started - Installing R and Rstudio

- You can install the latest version of R from the  [\textcolor{blue}{CRAN repository}](https://cran.r-project.org/). CRAN stands for **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork\newline

- The latest version or R is 4.0.5 as of time of the slide creation. This might change with time\newline

- Rstudio is an IDE (Intergrated Development Environment for R). You can install the latest version of Rstudio [\textcolor{blue}{here}](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

     - **NOTE:** You do not need Rstudio to use R, BUT it makes things easier. So I will highly recommend you to install Rstudio for easy and efficient coding in R.
